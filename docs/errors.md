## unexpected token '?'

Discord.js v13 requires node.js version 16.6 or newer to run! Click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install!
If you run your bot through a process manager, make sure to restart the daemon process to use the new node version
If you run on heroku or similar services, check out their documentation on how to update the node version (likely via the engines key in package.json)
Unsure you are using the right one? Log console.log(process.version) in your code
